<h1> Greetings, I'm Melanie Bessas</h1>
<h2>
    <p>I live in California but my husband and I are originally from Canada. We've been married 27 years. 
    We have a married oldest daughter, a missionary son and 2 high schoolers. I am taking Web design 
    because I find it a challenge and interesting. Programming does not come easily to me but I am
    determined. The programming class I took was hard for me but I'm hoping the more I do it the more 
    natural it will feel. Good luck to all of us!</p>
