        Welcome to FoxBe web works. 
        Have you ever searched the internet for a product or service only to find a website that is hard to navigate or confusing with too much or too little information? 
        My name is Melanie Bessas, I am a website, auditor and developer. I provide a vital service that can either audit what you currently have and offer insight for improvement with an action plan on how to achieve it.  
        If you are new to web based activity, I can walk your through the process and help you develop and launch a new website that will best show what you offer and maximize the purpose of your website.How we can help with your site: 
        Depending on your needs you can decide your level of involvement. We can take you with us step by step as we audit your site and show you where and why any changes may be needed. We can also do a complete audit autonomously and provide a detailed report and evidence based on valid and current trends and statistics. If you are starting from scratch you can decide how much of the process to be a part of, we pride ourselves on transparency.Prefer to build your own and just need a step up to get started?: 
        Perhaps you are wanting to spread your own wings for putting together a website? We can direct you to helpful sites that will give you design guidelines and templates that can be used, also public images if you do not have your own to utilize. Need a photographer to produce unique prints exclusive to your site, we can direct you in the right direction there too. 
        Ultimately this is your one stop shop for your web needs, welcome to FoxBe.
